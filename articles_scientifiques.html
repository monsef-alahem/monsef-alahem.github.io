<h1>Energy produced : human vs machines</h1>
<h4>
<h2>Some concepts about energy</h2>
<h4>
Energy is needed for movement and heat production and many other functions, here are some units to measure it:<br>
o joule(J) -> the energy required to lift 100g 1m high<br>
o calorie(cal) -> the energy required to raise the temperature of 1g of water by 1Â°C<br>
o watt(w) -> be careful! here we are talking about energy flow and not energy quantity, so we are talking about energy per unit of time, 1w = 1j/s, so if we have lifted a 100g apple 1m for 1s, we have provided 1w, during 2s 0,5w, during half a second (0.5s) 2w<br>
o horsepower (hp) -> another unit of energy flow (power). who has not heard of horsepower to appreciate a car engine. I speak here of the hp (1hp = 746w), because there is also the french horse (cheval: 1ch = 735.5w), the German horse (Ps) and ... the fiscal horse (cv), used in some countries to determine the tax to pay according to the engine power, which has nothing to do with the power unit.<br
o watt-hour -> Let's return to the energy, It is equivalent to 3600j, in fact it comes from the watt, the energy flow of 1w(1j/s) for 1 hour(3600seconds), hence 3600joules<br><br>

That's it for the units, let's see the energy that can be provided by the fuels and others:<br><br>

o 1L of petrol : 35555 kj <br>
o 1L of ethanol : 21300 kj <br>
o 1L of gasoline: 35555 kj <br>
o 1Kg of petrol : 47300 kj <br>
o 1Kg of wood : 16000 kj <br>
o 1Kg of fat : 33000 kj <br>
o 1Kg of grease : 33440 kj <br>
o 1Kg of butane : 16000 kj <br>
o 1Kg of butane : 49500 kj <br>
o 1g of uranium: 568880 kj, yes it is 1g<br><br>

<h2>Energy consumption in human</h2>
<h4>
When we talk about the energy burned by living beings, including humans, we use the calorie(cal)<br>
1 calorie = 4.18 joules

<h2>machines vs humans</h2>
<h4>
Let's compare the efficiency between man and machine and more, before moving on to energy, what is the efficiency first? well it's just the effective energy used out of the total energy, if we talk about a light bulb, the efficient energy is the light, while the total is the light + heat. Here are some examples of energy efficiencies:<br><br>

o gasoline engine: 36% mechanical energy, the rest lost in heat.<br>
o diesel engine: 42%, same here, the rest lost in heat.<br>
o electric motor: 90% same here.<br>
o photosynthesis: 6% solar energy transformed into biochemical energy, the rest, the plant can not exploit it.<br>
o muscle: 20% mechanical energy, the rest lost in heat.<br>
o solar panel or photovoltaic: 15% of solar energy converted into electrical energy.<br><br>


</h4>
<h2>Electric machines and humans ?</h2>
<h4>
Let us take a human of 70 kg, according to the table of earlier, it consumes 43 kcal during 1 hour of sleep it is the minimum and 1267 kcal during runing at 17,5 km/h for 1 hour. Let's also take a bulb of 60w and a radiator of 1600w.<br>
In order to compare we need to make conversions:<br><br>

1 hour of sleep -><br><br>

43kcal/h = 43000cal/h = (43000 x 4.184)d/h = 179912d/h = (179912/3600)d/s = 49.9d/s = 49.9w<br><br>

1 hour runing 17.5km/h-><br><br>

1267kcal/h = 1267000cal/h = (1267000 x 4.184)d/h = 5301128d/h = (5301128/3600)d/s = 1472.5d/s = 1472.5w<br><br>

So from the conversions, we can see that the consumption of a human is very variable depending on the activity, it goes approximately from a low consumption of a light bulb to the radiator one !
</h4>
<h2>Engine and humans?</h2>
<h4>
We always keep the example of earlier, the human of 70kg, for the engines we take the one of a 50cc scooter of 3hp or 2kwh and an engine 2,4L of an SUV with 190hp or 140kw.<br>
As before we need conversions:<br><br>

1 hour of sleep -><br><br>

49.9w = (49.9 / 746)hp = 0.067hp<br>
Don't forget, 49.9w = 0.0499kw<br><br>

1 hour runing 17.5km/h-><br><br>

1472.5w = (1472.5 / 746)hp = 1.97 hp<br>
Same here 1472.5w = 1.472kw<br><br>

According to the results obtained the thermal engine is much more energetic than the human, an engine can swallow Liters (kilos) of gasoline during one hour, while the human can live by drawing energy in 1kg of fat without eating anything for 3 days approximately (calories in 1kg of fat / caloric expenditure of a human per day <-> 8000kcal / 2390kcal = 3.35days), which explains the difficulty of losing weight.<br><br>

As reminder:<br>
1Kg of gasoline: 47300 kj = 11316 kcal<br>
1Kg of fat: 33440 kj = 8000 kcal<br>
</h4>
<h2>Little extra: estimate your own calorie expenditure!</h2>
<h4>
The used technique is based on the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm), the average turns around 60bpm at rest, with the effort it increases to a value not exceeding maximum heart rate (FCmax) which is estimated by the formula:<br><br>

FCmax = 220 - your age<br><br>

To estimate the bpm we count the beats during 10 seconds, then we multiply the value by 6, simple isn't it?<br>
We use it then to calculate the calories burned in this way:<br><br>

Caloric expenditure 1h effort = 24 x mass (bpm/(220-age)-0,25)<br><br>

As example:<br>
mass(your weight) = 50kg<br>
bpm = 72<br>
age = 22 years<br><br>


Cal exp 1h effor = 24 x 50 (72/(220-22)-0,25) = 136,4 kcal/h<br><br>

This same person has done a runing race, his bpm is now 160, let's calculate the new expenditure:<br><br>

Cal exp 1h effor = 24 x 50 (160/(220-22)-0,25) = 670 kcal/h<br><br>
