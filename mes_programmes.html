<h1>Programs of my principal github repository</h1>
<h4>
</h4>
<h2>Project 1 : Auto email from excel file</h2>
<h4>
This is a Python program that uses the XLRD module (so you will have to install this module in order to use the program) to read emails, names ..., from an Excel file and uses this information to send personalized emails automatically.<br><br>Notice: the e-mail address used by the program must have SMTP enabled.
</h4>
<h2>Project 2 : Auto email attach</h2>
<h4>
Same for this program except that it can send attachments, I designed this program to send hundreds of personalized resumes with one click, later I knew that my sister was sending emails for hours, then we had the idea to modify this program to personalize and send thousands of emails in a few seconds.<br><br>
This program yet simple and easy to realize (it took me only one afternoon) was able to save at least 13000$ according to one company <ho used it, as what the things do not need to be complex to make big money :).<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 3 : Deban</h2>
<h4>
This prog designed with AutoIt and Batch is about a fly (debana in arabic :p) that comes out during an adjustable interval in Batch part of the program, so goes the duration.<br><br>
The second Batch file isaba deban launches several flies in screen for an amusing effect :p.<br><br></h4>
<h2>Project 4 : SDL2 installer</h2>
<h4>
For those of the domain (C programmers) it is painful each time to install a new library (kind of extension of a programming language), of course I do not speak about Linux (only one line on Bash and that's it), but Windows, eh yes of the interminable copy and paste.<br><br>
with this program it's history, make the changes on the Batch file indicate the path of your C/C++ compiler, the Batch script will copy the SDL2 library elements in the appropriate location, there is even an program to test if the lib was well installed.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 5 : Tibib server-client chat (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
If you do network programming, this progam is a good example, it's a kind of simple demonstration of server-client mechanism, i've chatted with this prog many times.
It has some extra things like : change of text color on console, double compatibility (Linux, Windows), personalized encryption algorithm using a key of 100 chars and not 26 posibility for each char, but 256, that means 100E256 or 1 and 512 zeros :O (try to decrypt my message Choaib :p)<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 6 : Tibib chat GUI (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
Another chat program this time, with an SDL2 GUI still in the prototype stage.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 7 : Keyboard Racing (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
A program to race or evaluate your speed on the keyboard, ready? to your keyboard!<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 8 : Arab text to unicode converter</h2>
<h4>
Some libraries do not take into account the formatting of Arabic characters (writes all the letters in their isolated form), and the online converters that I found on the internet do not, so that's why I wrote this program, just write the desired Arabic words on "arabic_test.txt" then launch the program and finally retrieve your unicode on "utf_code.txt".<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 9 : Quran bahit (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
Do you want to know the recurrence of a word given in the Quraan? well this program is for you!
Of course I admit that there is better even on smartphone application, however I blieve the source code will help those in the field to understand how the searching a word works.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 10 : Keyboard Racing Arabic (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
We saw previously the race on keyboard in English, this time it is in Arabic, with the automatic assistant for the non-Arabic keyboard, moreover the text of the program is customisable on "data.txt", I let you discover :)<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 11 : Hijri Gregorian date converter (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
The C++ version of the program on console to convert a Gregorian date into a Hijri date and vice-versa, it uses the Julian calendar (Julian as in Julius Caesar, a kind of scientific calendar used in astronomy) as an intermediary between the two mentioned calendars.
Is based on the algorithm of the doctor Aly Abbara which uses the Julian calendar (Julian as Julius Caesar, a kind of scientific calendar used in astronomy) as an intermediary between the two calendars mentioned one above.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 12 : Date Converter (for mobile & PC)</h2>
<h4>
This time the Python version with Kivy (multi-platform lib) to convert dates, with as a bonus, a history of converted dates.<br><br>
</h4>

<h2>Project 13 : Andek Lbelgha (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
It is a simple observation game, a young person shoot you with a "Belgha" a kind of Moroccan shoes, but as soon as he raises his hand, be first to shoot him :p, but be careful sometimes he raises it just to scratch his head in this case, you will be disqualified if you shoot him !<br><br>
</h4>

<h2>Project 14 : zaitoun utilities (for mobile & PC)</h2>
<h4>
Versatile program using the "pyIslam" library (thanks Abdelhak, thanks to the contributors), calculates prayer times and converts solar dates into lunar dates, both with the astronomical calculation method rather than with a database, so no need for internet :), without forgetting the calculation of zakat and mirath.<br><br>
</h4>

<h2>Project 15 : zaitoun mind trainer (for mobile & PC)</h2>
<h4>
With this app, you will work on your ability to memorize numbers, as well as your reasoning, well I let you discover.<br><br>
</h4>

<h1>Programs of my secondary github repository</h1>
<h2>Project 1 : Quran Tin (for mobile & PC)</h2>
<h4>
One of my most successful programs, a colorful "Hafs 'an assim" (oriental reading) Quraan, with the option of automatic reading with adjustable time, hizb progress bar and page number selector.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 2 : Quran Rotaba (for mobile & PC) (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
A portage for mobile of my old C++ project "Quraan Rajii", still not finished.<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 3 : Quran Rotaba (C++ + SFML) (prototype)</h2>
<h4>
A remake for "Quraan Rajii", the pupose is to rwrite the code due to the messy code in the original one -_-<br><br>
</h4>
<h2>Project 4 : Modawin hifz al quran (for mobile & PC)</h2>
<h4>
For those who memorize the Quraan, you can note your progress with this program, press in the blank to know the meaning of the colors.<br><br>

<h1>Autres</h1>
<h2>Project 0 : Al Quraan Rajii</h2>
<h4>
	It's an educational game also one of my first projects, it took me 5 months at the time. the goal of the game is to choose among three choices the Aya that follows and so on, convenient to learn or review Quraan.<br><br>
	Of course there are other features, like auto-saving your session when you quit, bookmark with l and s, display help with f1, change color, get the duration of your session as well as the total duration (the time you have spent using the program since downloading it)<br><br>
